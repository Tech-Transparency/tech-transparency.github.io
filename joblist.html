        <h1>Best Business-Side Jobs at Tech Companies</h1>


        <p>
          Please note that for some of these jobs, the application hasnâ€™t opened yet. We tried to include the best link possible of where to go about finding the job listing once it is posted, like the link from last year. We hope this helps!
          <!-- "I" for Parth-only -->
        </p>

        <p>
          Below each job listing, one of our cofounders will note his experiences with and opinions of the job.
        </p>
