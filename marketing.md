# HOW TO GET A PRODUCT MARKETING JOB

_By [Jeremy Schifeling](https://www.breakinto.tech/)._

***

## **STEP 1: WHAT ARE PRODUCT MARKETING JOBS ALL ABOUT?**

Example: Product Specs

* **AKA**: Product Marketing Management (PMM)
* **Overview**: Marketing solves the Field of Dreams problem: Wrongly assuming that if we just build it, they will come. By bringing the product directly to the market, marketers make sure that customers are actually aware of the latest and greatest.
* **Example project**: Develop a go-to-market campaign to launch the iPad.
* **What you do all day**: Research your audience, plan campaigns, execute campaigns, measure results
* **Roles**: Product Marketing Manager (manages how a product is brought to market), Copywriter/Voice + Tone (generates copy for marketing campaign), Marketing Operations (executes marketing campaigns via email and advertising), PR/Communications (engages press to get the word out)
* **What they look for**: Candidates with a mix of creative and analytical skills
* **Example job**: Product Marketing Manager, Uber

## **STEP 2: WOULD YOU BE A GOOD FIT FOR PRODUCT MARKETING?**

Ask yourself if you'd love doing these kinds of things all day:

* Understanding the marketplace and customers
* Partnering with the product team to develop features that serve the audience well
* Positioning products to appeal to those customers
* Working cross-functionally with designers and copy-writers to develop campaigns
* Analyzing campaign results and optimizing based on the data 

If your answer is "Yes" to the majority of activities, you'd likely be a good fit for Product Marketing jobs.

If you want to brush up on any of these skills, check out Brad Batesole's [Online Marketing Fundamentals course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/online-marketing-foundations-3?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.1229001_net.mediapartner_plc.Break%20into%20Tech_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.1229001_net.mediapartner_plc.Break%20into%20Tech_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1) on Lynda. I like two things about this course in particular:

1. It's comprehensive. There are so many new marketing tools at your disposal these days - SEO, search, display, social media, video, email, etc. - and Brad covers them all!
2. But it's still grounded in hard-core strategy. Too many marketers get caught up in all the latest growth hacking tricks without establishing a clear strategy. And so Brad makes sure you have that firm foundation before moving on.

Plus, you can complete the whole course in a day - and [you've got a whole month to take it for free](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/online-marketing-foundations-3?trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.1229001_net.mediapartner_plc.Break%20into%20Tech_pcrid.449670_learning&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.1229001_net.mediapartner_plc.Break%20into%20Tech_pcrid.449670_learning&irgwc=1). So definitely a great way to get started in this field!
