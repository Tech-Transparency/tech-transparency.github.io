# HOW TO GET A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT JOB

_By [Jeremy Schifeling](https://www.breakinto.tech/)._

## **STEP 1: WHAT ARE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT JOBS ALL ABOUT?**

Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

* **AKA**: BD, BizDev
* **Overview**: BD is like sales without money. You work with other companies to form partnerships - but instead of closing a paid deal, the companies barter something valuable to each of them. For instance, early in Google’s existence, it did a BD deal with Yahoo! that made it the default search engine. In exchange for getting access to Yahoo’s millions of users, Google made Yahoo more effective for its customers.
* **Example project**: Partner with HBO to make sure that its original programming is available on the Apple TV at launch.
* **What you do all day**: Explore opportunities, build relationships, propose/close deals
* **Roles**: Business Development Manager/Representative
What they look for: Candidates with strong interpersonal and negotiation skills
* **Example job**: [Relationship Manager - Business Development, Apple Pay](http://www.awesomescreenshot.com/image/883029/5bc2e169dc20ecbd9195d94782dcafb8)


## **STEP 2: WOULD YOU BE A GOOD FIT FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT?**

Ask yourself if you'd love doing these kinds of things all day:

* Exploring the landscape of potential partners
* Building relationships
* Proposing partnerships that provide mutual value
* Negotiating and finalizing deals
* Managing relationships and deal implementation

If your answer is "Yes" to the majority of activities, you'd likely be a good fit for BizDev jobs.

If you want to brush up on any of these skills, check out Scott Britton's [Business Development for Startups and Tech Companies](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=62sJzUm1CLs&subid=&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fbusiness-development-strategy-startups%2F) course on Udemy. I like two things about this course in particular:

1. It's comprehensive. It covers everything from high-level BizDev strategy all the way down to the nuts-and-bolts of how to find the exact right partner's email address.
 
2. And it's also step-by-step. Scott literally walks you through every part of the relationship-building process in a way that lots of other people would just gloss over ("So I connected with this guy and then we did a deal...")
